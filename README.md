# OpenCode-SuperClaude Integration Project

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains comprehensive architectural plans and documentation for integrating [OpenCode](https://github.com/Kirchlive/opencode) with [SuperClaude](https://github.com/Kirchlive/superclaude) capabilities, creating a powerful AI-enhanced development environment.

### 🎯 Vision

Transform OpenCode from a standalone CLI tool into an extensible, AI-powered development platform that seamlessly integrates with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) while maintaining performance, security, and developer experience.

## 📊 Integration Approaches

We've developed **5 distinct integration strategies**, each optimized for different scenarios:

| Plan | Timeline | Complexity | Best For |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| [INTEGRATION.md](./INTEGRATION.md) | 10 days | Medium | Rapid MVP deployment |
| [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) | 6 weeks | Medium-High | Full-featured integration |
| [EDA.md](./EDA.md) | 8 weeks | High | Production-ready plugins |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | 8-10 weeks | Very High | Community ecosystem |
| [EVENTDRIVEN.md](./EVENTDRIVEN.md) | 4-8 months | Very High | Enterprise architecture |
