**Context**: Rather than pursuing a single integration approach, the team developed five distinct architectural plans to address different use cases, timelines, and organizational needs.

**Decision**: Maintain five parallel integration approaches:
1. **Plugin Ecosystem Architecture** (8-10 weeks) - Community-driven extensible platform
2. **SuperClaude Integration** (10 days) - Rapid prompt broker integration
3. **MCP Bridge + Plugin + EDA** (4-8 months) - Enterprise-grade multi-tier architecture
4. **MCP Plugin EDA Architecture** (8 weeks) - Production-ready plugin system
5. **SuperClaude Implementation** (6 weeks) - Full-featured prompt service

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Different organizations have varying requirements, timelines, and capabilities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple paths reduce single-point-of-failure risk
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Allows starting simple and evolving to complex architectures
- **Community Choice**: Provides options for different community segments

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single "one-size-fits-all" architecture ‚Üí Rejected due to diverse requirements
- Two-tier approach (simple vs complex) ‚Üí Insufficient granularity for varied needs
- Complete rewrite strategy ‚Üí Too risky and time-consuming

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Provides clear migration paths between approaches
- ‚úÖ Addresses immediate needs while planning for future growth
- ‚ùå Increases documentation and maintenance overhead
- ‚ùå May create confusion without proper guidance

### ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture Adoption
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

**Context**: Multiple plans incorporate event-driven patterns for loose coupling, real-time updates, and scalability.

**Decision**: Implement event-driven architecture with:
- **Message Brokers**: NATS JetStream for <10k msg/s, Kafka for >10k msg/s
- **Event Patterns**: Publish-Subscribe, Event Sourcing, CQRS where appropriate
- **Topic Design**: Domain-driven (e.g., `sc.prompt.executed`, `oc.plugin.error`)
- **Delivery Guarantees**: At-least-once delivery with idempotent consumers

**Rationale**:
- **Scalability**: Supports growth from single-user to enterprise scale
- **Decoupling**: Reduces tight coupling between components
- **Real-time**: Enables hot-reload, live updates, reactive UIs
- **Resilience**: Better fault tolerance and system recovery

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Synchronous-only** ‚Üí Simpler but limits scalability and real-time features
- **HTTP webhooks** ‚Üí Standard but less reliable for high-frequency events
- **Database polling** ‚Üí Simple but inefficient and high latency

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Start with in-memory events for rapid development plans
- Graduate to NATS for production-ready implementations
- Reserve Kafka for enterprise-scale deployments

### ADR-004: Security and Isolation Strategy
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Decision Makers**: Security Team, Architecture Team

**Context**: Plugin architectures require robust security to prevent malicious or faulty plugins from compromising the host system.

**Decision**: Multi-layered security approach:
- **Process Isolation**: Plugins run in separate OS processes
- **Mutual TLS**: All plugin communication encrypted and authenticated
- **Capability-based Security**: Plugins declare and are granted specific permissions
- **Sandboxing**: Future consideration for WASM or container-based isolation
- **Code Signing**: Plugin binaries signed for integrity verification

**Rationale**:
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers reduce single-point-of-failure
- **Community Safety**: Enables community plugins while maintaining security
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security requirements
- **Future-proof**: Architecture supports additional security measures

**Security Threat Model**:
- **Malicious Plugins**: Process isolation and permission model
- **Supply Chain**: Code signing and hash verification
- **Data Exfiltration**: Capability-based access control
- **System Compromise**: Sandboxing and resource limits
